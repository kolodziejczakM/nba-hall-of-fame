# NBA Hall of Fame in Vue

## What I would recommend to do next:

### Dev env
* Add Stylelint - to unify scss style & set specific rules
* Add Plop - to generate boilerplate faster - components, services, style files generation
* Add Storybook - to make UI well-documented

### App
* Add translations mechanism
* Add simple offline support
* Add simple pre-rendering
+ If this is going to be bigger - migrate from Cache service to Vuex.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
